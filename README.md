## ðŸŸ¢ About

The primary focus of this frontend project was to gain hands-on experience in fetching and utilizing various React hooks to manipulate data. The backend was purely coded to work flawlessly. Although, it's not directly connected to any database. While the design wasn't my top priority, it still manages to be effective and serves its purpose splendidly.
