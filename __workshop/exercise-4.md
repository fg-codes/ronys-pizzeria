# Exercise 4 - Order Confirmed!

Did you really think you were done fetching? It's not over yet! ðŸ˜ˆ

In the last exercise, you needed to send the `orderId` as a URL Parameter to `"/confirm/:orderId"`. In this one you'll need to grab it to run... you guessed it! Another `fetch`! 

Create a `Confirmation` component at the `Route` mentioned above. Get the `orderId` from the URL and use it to `fetch` the order's information from the server and display it on the page! No screenshot this time, just put all the information that the server returns on the page. 

Make it easy to read and you can even give them a classic "Pizza will arrive in _X amount of time_ or it's free!"

Try not to make it as ugly as you think I would have made it ðŸ˜‚.

Remember to look at the [API Documentation](../server/API_DOC.md) to figure out what address you need to `fetch`!
