# Exercise 8 - Fixing the whole thing! **(stretch)**

This time you're dealing with a pretty rare case, everything about the order needs to be updated!

Similar to what you did in [exercise 6](exercise-6.md), you'll add another button that will allow you to update the form. But this time it will un-disable (enable) all the fields! This will be a **complete rewrite** of the order.

Once you submit the changes, send it to the server with the appropriate `fetch`. Alert the admin of the results of the update, and redirect them to the admin pannel if everything worked out with the [useNavigate](https://reactrouter.com/en/main/hooks/use-navigate) hook.

> Sorry this one looks weird, I had to shrink the size so it could fit on GitHub ðŸ˜….

Remember to look at the [API Documentation](../server/API_DOC.md) to figure out what address you need to `fetch`!
